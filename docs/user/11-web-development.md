# Web Development

Geblang's web story supports APIs and server-rendered applications without
trying to become a large full-stack framework.

The intended shape is Flask-like: a small set of routing, middleware, request,
response, session, cache, and rendering primitives that framework authors can
compose. Applications can use those primitives directly, and larger frameworks
can layer conventions on top.

## Native Web Module

```gb
import http;
import web;

let app = web.new();

web.before(app, func(Request req): ?Response {
    return null;
});

web.get(app, "/users/:id", func(Request req): Response {
    return http.jsonResponse({"id": req.routeParam("id")});
});

http.serve("127.0.0.1:8080", func(dict<string, any> request): dict<string, any> {
    return web.handle(app, request);
});
```

Middleware registered with `web.before` can short-circuit before the route
handler. `web.use` and `web.after` transform responses after the handler.

A handler opts into the rich `Request` and `Response` objects (see the HTTP
chapter) just by declaring those parameter types: `Request` gives typed
accessors like `req.routeParam("id")`, `req.queryInt("page")`, and
`req.header(name)`, and `http.jsonResponse` / `http.response` / `http.redirect`
build a `Response`. A handler can still take a plain request `dict` and return a
response `dict`, a string (normalized to a `200` text response), or `null`
(normalized to `204 No Content`); both styles can be mixed across routes. The
`web.handle` boundary itself stays dict-in / dict-out, so the serve wrapper does
not change.

Before middleware receives `(request)` and should return `null` to continue or
a response to stop the pipeline. Response middleware receives
`(request, response)` and should return the transformed response:

```gb
web.before(app, func(Request req): ?Response {
    if (req.header("authorization") == null) {
        return http.jsonResponse({"error": "missing token"}, 401);
    }
    return null;
});

web.use(app, func(Request req, Response response): Response {
    return response.withHeader("X-App", "Geblang");
});
```

## Source Web Modules

Source web modules are split by responsibility: `web.http` handles
request/response/context helpers, `web.router` handles routing and decorator
mounting, `web.session` handles sessions and flash messages, `web.cache`
handles cache stores, `web.auth` handles current-user helpers and CSRF,
`web.validation` wraps schema validation for request input, `web.forms`
provides SSR form helpers, `web.middleware` provides reusable middleware,
`web.sse` formats server-sent events, `web.websocket` handles WebSocket
upgrades and clients, and `web.testing` provides dispatch helpers for route
tests.

```gb
import web.http as wh;
import web.router as router;

let app = router.newRouter();
let api = router.group(app, "/api");

router.get(api, "/users/:id", func(dict<string, any> request): dict<string, any> {
    let ctx = wh.context(request);
    return wh.jsonStatus({"id": ctx.param("id")}, 200);
});
```

Route groups add a prefix without hiding the underlying router:

```gb
let admin = router.group(app, "/admin");

router.before(admin, auth.requireRole(sessionStore, "admin"));
router.get(admin, "/users", listUsers);
router.post(admin, "/users", createUser);
```

`wh.context(request)` provides a higher-level request wrapper for params,
query values, form data, cookies, sessions, rendering, and response helpers.
`wh.requestObject(request)` and `wh.responseFrom(response)` are useful when a
handler or middleware wants explicit request/response objects without adopting
the full context wrapper:

```gb
router.get(api, "/users/:id", func(dict<string, any> request): dict<string, any> {
    let req = wh.requestObject(request);
    return wh.responseObject(200, {"id": req.param("id")})
        .header("X-Route", "users.show")
        .toDict();
});

router.use(api, func(dict<string, any> request, dict<string, any> response): dict<string, any> {
    if (wh.statusCode(response) >= 500) {
        return wh.withHeader(response, "X-Error", "server");
    }
    return response;
});
```

## Concurrency And Shared State

Geblang serves each request on its own lightweight goroutine, so requests run
in parallel. This is what lets a Geblang server stay responsive under load, but
it means you have to be deliberate about state that more than one request can
touch at the same time.

The model has two halves:

- A bare server handler passed straight to `http.serve` / `http.listen` /
  `net.serve` runs **isolated per request**. Each request gets its own fresh
  copy of whatever the handler captured, so a counter captured in a bare
  handler resets every request and concurrent requests cannot interfere. Simple
  scripts are therefore safe by default; the trade-off is that captured state
  does not persist from one request to the next.
- When you dispatch through the framework path (`web.handle`, the source
  `web.router`, and frameworks built on them), handlers and the application's
  services are **shared across requests**. This is the service model you want:
  one set of controllers, one database pool, one configuration, reused by every
  request.

A bare handler can opt into the shared model with an option:
`http.serve(addr, handler, {"shareHandler": true})` (also `http.listen` and
`net.serve(host, port, handler, {"shareHandler": true})`).
The handler and its captured state are then shared across requests instead of
cloned per request - this is how a framework keeps one application graph. When a
handler is shared, the `store.Store` rule below applies.

Shared is the useful default for the framework path, but it comes with one
rule: **do not mutate a plain `dict`, `list`, `set`, or object that is shared
across requests.** Two requests writing the same container at the same instant
can crash the process. This is the same contract Go itself has for maps, and
the same discipline every multi-threaded web stack requires.

What to do instead:

- Share read-only state freely. Configuration, compiled templates, and services
  that only read are safe to share as-is.
- Share infrastructure through its handle. A database pool, cache backend, or
  logger is a thread-safe handle; create it once at startup and every request
  can use it.
- Share **mutable** state through a `store.Store` (see the async chapter). It is
  a thread-safe key-value store with atomic operations, built for exactly this.

```gb
import http;
import web;
import store;

let app = web.new();

/* Shared across all requests: use a Store, not a plain dict. */
let hits = store.Store();

web.get(app, "/", func(Request req): Response {
    int n = hits.incr("home");          /* atomic; no lost updates */
    return http.jsonResponse({"visits": n});
});

http.serve("127.0.0.1:8080", func(dict<string, any> request): dict<string, any> {
    return web.handle(app, request);
});
```

Per-request state, by contrast, lives in the request object and in local
variables inside the handler. Those are never shared, so they need no
protection.

## Request Validation

`web.validation` wraps the lower-level `schema` module for common API and form
handlers. Validation results include `valid`, `errors`, and parsed `data`.

```gb
import web.validation as validation;

let userRules = validation.object({
    "name": validation.stringField(),
    "roles": validation.arrayOf(validation.stringField())
}, ["name"]);

router.post(api, "/users", func(dict<string, any> request): dict<string, any> {
    let result = validation.json(request, userRules);
    if (!validation.isValid(result)) {
        return validation.errorResponse(result);
    }
    let data = validation.data(result);
    return wh.jsonCreated({"name": data["name"]});
});
```

Use `validation.form(request, rules)` for SSR form posts and
`validation.validate(data, rules)` when the input is already parsed.

## SSR Forms

`web.forms` builds on `web.validation`, `web.auth`, and `web.session` for
server-rendered form workflows:

```gb
import web.forms as forms;
import web.validation as validation;

let profileRules = validation.object({
    "name": validation.stringField()
}, ["name"]);

router.post(app, "/profile", func(dict<string, any> request): dict<string, any> {
    let result = forms.validate(request, profileRules);
    if (!forms.isValid(result)) {
        return wh.htmlStatus(forms.firstFieldError(result, "name"), 422);
    }
    return forms.redirectSuccess(sessionStore, request, "/profile", "Saved", {});
});
```

Use `forms.csrfField(token)` when rendering a hidden CSRF input,
`forms.withCsrf(response, secret, options)` to set the CSRF cookie, and
`forms.verifyCsrf(request, secret)` when handling the post.

## Common Middleware

`web.middleware` provides reusable response middleware for the common HTTP
concerns that most apps need early:

```gb
import web.middleware as middleware;

router.use(app, middleware.securityHeaders());
router.use(app, middleware.requestId());
router.use(app, middleware.cors("https://example.com", "GET, POST", "Content-Type, Authorization"));
```

`securityHeaders()` adds conservative browser security headers,
`requestId()` propagates or creates an `X-Request-ID` response header, and
`cors()`/`corsCredentials()` add CORS headers. `accessLog(logger)` logs method,
path, and status through the `log` module after a response is produced.

## Server-Sent Events

`web.sse` formats event-stream responses using the same response dictionary
shape as the rest of the web modules:

```gb
import web.sse as sse;

router.get(app, "/events", func(dict<string, any> request): dict<string, any> {
    return sse.response([
        sse.comment("ready"),
        sse.event("user.created", "{\"id\":42}", {"id": "42"}),
        sse.retry(5000)
    ]);
});
```

Use `sse.streaming(handler)` for long-lived event streams. The handler receives
an `sse.EventStream` and can write and flush SSE frames while the request stays
open:

```gb
router.get(app, "/live", func(dict<string, any> request): dict<string, any> {
    return sse.streaming(func(sse.EventStream stream): void {
        stream.write(sse.comment("connected"));
        stream.flush();
    });
});
```

## WebSockets

WebSocket routes use the same router and response dictionary contract as HTTP
routes. `web.websocket.upgrade(handler)` produces an upgrade response; the
handler runs after the HTTP connection has become a WebSocket:

```gb
import web.websocket as ws;

router.get(app, "/ws", func(dict<string, any> request): dict<string, any> {
    return ws.upgrade(func(ws.Connection conn): void {
        let message = conn.readJson();
        conn.sendJson({"echo": message["text"]});
        conn.close();
    });
});
```

The source wrapper also provides clients, so examples and integration tests can
exercise both sides without dropping to the lower-level native module:

```gb
let conn = ws.connect("ws://127.0.0.1:8080/ws");
conn.sendJson({"text": "hello"});
let reply = conn.readJson();
conn.close();
```

## Sessions, Auth, Cache

Server-side session stores are available for Redis, files, and SQL databases.
Cache stores follow a shared `get`, `set`, `delete`, `has` contract.

Auth helpers store the current user in the session and provide middleware
guards:

```gb
router.before(api, auth.requireAuth(sessionStore));
router.before(admin, auth.requireRole(sessionStore, "admin"));
router.before(editor, auth.requirePermission(sessionStore, "posts.edit"));
```

The middleware helpers return callable guard values, so they can be passed directly
to `router.before`, decorator policy maps, or a framework layer. Lower-level
helpers such as `auth.currentUser`, `auth.userHasRole`, and
`auth.userHasPermission` remain available when custom guard logic needs more
than a single role or permission check.

Use file sessions for local apps and small deployments, Redis sessions when
multiple app processes need shared state, and database sessions when the
application already depends on SQL persistence and operational simplicity is
more important than raw session throughput.

Flash messages and CSRF helpers are included for server-rendered forms:

```gb
let response = session.withFlash(sessionStore, wh.redirect("/settings"), request, "success", "Saved", {});
response = auth.withCsrf(response, secret, {});
```

## SSR

SSR uses regular string/template helpers rather than a custom Geblang template
language:

```gb
router.get(app, "/page", func(dict<string, any> request): dict<string, any> {
    let ctx = wh.context(request);
    return ctx.render("<h1>{{.title}}</h1>", {"title": "Geblang"});
});
```

For larger apps, keep templates as files and render them through the `template`
module or a thin application wrapper. Geblang deliberately avoids requiring a
custom template language for SSR.

## Decorator Direction

Decorator-driven routing and middleware let framework code register handlers
from metadata:

```gb
@route("GET", "/users/:id")
@loginRequired
func showUser(dict<string, any> request): dict<string, any> {
    ...
}
```

Framework code should scan decorator metadata with `reflect` and register
routes/middleware without new syntax.

The building blocks are:

- Decorators attach metadata to functions, methods, classes, and static methods.
- `reflect.decorators(value)` and `reflect.hasDecorator(value, name)` expose
  that metadata.
- `web.router.mount(router, controller)` registers plain route metadata.
- `web.router.mountWithOptions(router, controller, options)` can map decorator
  metadata to middleware and policy guards.
- Decorators such as `loginRequired`, `isGranted`, `requireRole`, or
  `requirePermission` can stay metadata-only and be interpreted by the router.

Example controller shape:

```gb
import web.http as wh;
import web.session as session;

let sessions = session.fileSessionStore("/tmp/app-sessions", 3600);

class UserController {
    @route("GET", "/users/:id")
    @loginRequired
    @isGranted("admin")
    func show(dict<string, any> request): dict<string, any> {
        let ctx = wh.context(request);
        return wh.jsonStatus({"id": ctx.param("id")}, 200);
    }
}

let app = router.newRouter();
let api = router.group(app, "/api");

router.mountWithOptions(api, UserController(), {
    "sessionStore": sessions
});
```

The goal is not to make decorators mandatory. Direct registration remains the
lowest-level API and the best fit for small scripts.

`mountWithOptions` currently understands:

- Route decorators: `@route("GET", "/path")`, plus verb aliases such as
  `@get("/path")`, `@post("/path")`, `@put`, `@patch`, `@delete`, and
  `@options` where supported by the parser/runtime path in use.
- Auth decorators with a `sessionStore` option: `@loginRequired`,
  `@requireAuth`, `@isGranted("role")`, `@requireRole("role")`, and
  `@requirePermission("permission")`.
- Named middleware decorators through the `middleware` option map.
- Class-level prefix decorators such as `@prefix("/api")` are represented in
  metadata, but grouping with `router.group` is the most explicit and portable
  option today.

For custom policy decorators with arguments, a framework layer can read
`reflect.decorators` directly and register the route however it wants. The
stdlib router keeps the built-in policy mapping intentionally small.

## Practical App Layout

An application can keep HTTP wiring thin and put behavior in modules:

```text
src/
  main.gb
  http/
    routes.gb
    controllers.gb
    middleware.gb
  domain/
    users.gb
  storage/
    users_repository.gb
```

`main.gb` should create shared services, create the router, mount routes, and
start `http.serve`. Controllers should translate HTTP requests to domain calls
and return response dictionaries.
