# Standard Library Overview

Geblang's standard library is intentionally broad enough for everyday work, but
not designed as a monolithic application framework. It should give you the
building blocks for CLI tools, scripts, APIs, SSR web apps, background jobs,
data processing, integration code, and small framework layers without forcing a
single style of application structure.

The library has two implementation layers:

- Native modules are implemented in Go and are available in normal Geblang
  builds. These cover host integration, runtime-sensitive behavior, networking,
  parsing, database drivers, bytecode/VM parity surfaces, and value classes
  that need native state.
- Source modules are written in Geblang and distributed under `stdlib/`. These
  provide higher-level composition, convenience wrappers, framework-style web
  helpers, and APIs that can evolve in userland.

Both layers are imported the same way. Modules are not injected into the global
namespace, so programs should import the capabilities they use:

```gb
import io;
import json;
import async.io as aio;
import web.http as wh;
import web.router as router;
```

Most modules use typed values for stable concepts and plain dictionaries or
lists at dynamic boundaries such as parsed JSON, request metadata, validation
errors, and driver options. Application code can keep those structures dynamic
or convert them into typed classes when the shape matters.

  decorators, middleware, sessions, cache/auth/form helpers, SSE, and web
  testing support.

Operations, introspection, and extension:

- [Observability](observability.html): logging, metrics, tracing, profiling,
  and custom log handlers.
- [Reflection And Testing](reflect-test.html): runtime metadata, docblocks,
  decorators, function/class/module reflection, and class-based testing.
- [Environment and Extensions](env-ext.html): dotenv, external extension
  processes, extension protocol calls, and binary frame handling.

  libraries (libtorch, libsqlite, libcurl, ...) with capability gating.

  image analysis, and image generation across OpenAI, Anthropic, and AWS
  Bedrock.
- [Vector Search and RAG](vectorstore-rag.html): in-memory and SQLite-backed
  vector stores with similarity search, plus retrieval-augmented-generation
  helpers (chunking, indexing, retrieval, prompt-context assembly).
- [Local Models](onnx-transformers.html): offline WordPiece tokenization, ONNX
  model inference, and on-device sentence-transformer embeddings (experimental;
  needs ONNX Runtime and the `--allow-onnx` flag).

  Protocol for functional testing and scripted control - navigate, interact,
  read, screenshot, cookies, request interception (experimental; needs Chrome
  and the `--allow-browser` flag).

  (READY, WATCHDOG, STATUS) and structured journald logging. Linux only.

  window init, cursor movement, keyboard input, and colour/attribute control.
- [Image](image.html): portable native raster-image module (PNG, JPEG, GIF,
  WebP decode; PNG/JPEG/GIF encode); load, blank, resize, crop, rotate, and

  arithmetic with broadcasting, zero-copy views, reductions, linear algebra,

- [dataframe](dataframe.html): columnar data frames - typed columns with null

  columns bridge to ndarray.
- [Utility Modules](utilities.html): miscellaneous result, option, and helper
  modules that do not fit one larger category.

Generated source API pages are available under the API section of the site. They
are useful for quick exported-signature lookup, but the module reference pages
above are the primary documentation because they include behavior notes and
examples.

## Import And Resolution Notes

Native modules are always available in a normal Geblang binary. Source modules
resolve from the bundled stdlib, package roots, and `GEBLANG_STDLIB`.

Built-in module names (native and stdlib) are reserved: a program or package may
not declare a module with one of these names, and built-in names always resolve
to the built-in identically on both backends. Use `import geblang.X` to refer to
a built-in explicitly. See "Reserved built-in module names" in the Modules and
Packages chapter for details.

Prefer explicit aliases when a module name would otherwise be noisy or collide
with local names:

```gb
import web.http as wh;
import async.io as aio;
import testing.assertions as assert;
```

Top-level code in source modules runs when the module is imported. Stdlib
modules avoid side effects except where the module is explicitly about host
integration, such as environment or extension loading. Application modules
should follow the same rule: export functions/classes for reusable behavior and
keep executable startup code in scripts or command entry points.
