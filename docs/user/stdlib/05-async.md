# Async

Geblang's async model is based on tasks - lightweight concurrent units of work
backed by goroutines. An `async func` starts immediately when called and returns
a `Task<T>`. A plain `func` can be wrapped into a task with `async.run`.

## Starting tasks

```gb
import async;

async func fetchUser(int id): dict {
    await async.sleep(10);   # simulate I/O
    return {"id": id, "name": "Alice"};
}

let task = fetchUser(1);       # starts immediately; returns Task<dict>
let user = await task;         # wait for result
```

`async.run(callable)` wraps any callable as a task:

```gb
let task = async.run(func(): string {
    return "done";
});
let result = await task;
```

## Concurrency: start first, await later

The whole point of tasks is to overlap work. Do not immediately `await` every
task:

```gb
import async.io as aio;   # task-returning file I/O (see "Async I/O submodules")

# Good - both I/O operations run in parallel
let configTask   = aio.readText("config/app.json");
let templateTask = aio.readText("templates/page.html");

let config   = await configTask;
let template = await templateTask;

# Bad - sequential despite async
let config   = await aio.readText("config/app.json");
let template = await aio.readText("templates/page.html");
```

## Checking task status

```gb
let done = async.done(task);   # bool - true if the task has finished
```

Use `async.done` to poll rather than block, for example in a progress loop
with `sys.sleep`.

## Combining tasks

`async.all([tasks])` waits for every input task to complete and returns the
results as an ordered list. If any task fails, the rest are cancelled and the
first error is re-thrown when the result is awaited.

```gb
let pages = await async.all([fetchPage(1), fetchPage(2), fetchPage(3)]);
io.println("got " + (pages.length() as string) + " pages");
```

`async.race([tasks])` returns the value of the first task to finish. The
remaining tasks are cancelled.

```gb
let winner = await async.race([primary(), backup()]);
```

## Timeouts

`async.timeout(task, ms)` wraps a task with a millisecond deadline. If the
inner task does not complete in time it is cancelled and the wrapper task
re-throws a `RuntimeError` ("async.timeout: task did not complete within Nms")
when the wrapper is awaited. The error propagates out of the script unless
caught further up.

```gb
let response = await async.timeout(ahttp.get(url), 2000);
```

## Cancellation

A task can be cancelled with `async.cancel(task)` or `task.cancel()`. After
cancellation, `task.cancelled` is `true` and any `await` returns a sentinel
error. Long-running work should check periodically (for example by `await`-ing
short sleeps) to allow cancellation to take effect.

```gb
let job = async.run(func(): int {
    await async.sleep(1000);
    return 1;
});

job.cancel();
io.println(job.cancelled);    # true
```

## Sleeping

```gb
await async.sleep(1000);          # pause for 1 second inside an async func
async.sleep(500);                 # returns a Task<null>; await it to pause
```

`async.sleep` is non-blocking. It yields the goroutine for the given number of
milliseconds without freezing the process.

## Scheduling: Timer, Ticker, Interval

For callback-style scheduling (fire-once or repeating), import
`time.scheduler`. The classes wrap async tasks with cancellation:

```gb
import time.scheduler as sched;

# Fire once after 500ms; cancellable.
let t = sched.Timer(500, func(): void {
    io.println("done");
});

# Fire every 1s until stopped.
let ticker = sched.Ticker(1000, func(): void {
    io.println("tick");
});
# ...
ticker.stop();

# Run the callback immediately, then every interval.
let poll = sched.Interval(60000, refreshConfig);
poll.stop();
```

`sched.setTimeout(ms, fn)` and `sched.setInterval(ms, fn)` are aliases that
match JavaScript naming for callers more familiar with that vocabulary.

| Method | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `Timer.cancel()` | void | Prevents the callback from firing if it has not yet run. |
| `Timer.didFire()` | bool | True after the callback runs; false if cancelled in time. |
| `Timer.wait()` | Task | Resolves once the timer fires or is cancelled. |
| `Ticker.stop()` | void | Halts further ticks; an in-flight tick still completes. |
| `Ticker.ticks()` | int | How many times the callback has run so far. |
| `Ticker.wait()` | Task | Resolves once the ticker is stopped. |

## Error handling in tasks

If a task panics or returns an error, `await` re-throws it:

```gb
try {
    let result = await riskyTask;
} catch (error e) {
    io.println("task failed: " + e.message);
}
```

## Structured concurrency: `async.scope`

Import the `async.scope` module (aliased below as `ascope`) and call
`ascope.scope(body)`. It runs `body` with a fresh `TaskGroup` and
guarantees that every child task spawned inside the body is awaited
before the call returns. If the body throws, or any child task
throws, the remaining children are cancelled and the first error is
rethrown after the drain completes. Tasks that don't surface a
cancellation signal still run to completion - `async.cancel` is
cooperative.

```gb
import async;
import async.scope as ascope;

let users = ascope.scope(func(any group): list<dict<string, any>> {
    let a = group.spawn(func(): dict<string, any> { return fetchUser(1); });
    let b = group.spawn(func(): dict<string, any> { return fetchUser(2); });
    return [async.await(a), async.await(b)];
});
```

The group exposes two methods directly:

- `group.spawn(callable fn)` - starts `fn` as a new task and returns
  the `Task` value. Throws if the group has already been cancelled.
- `group.cancel()` - flags the group cancelled and signals every
  in-flight child.

Spawned tasks are no different from those returned by `async.run` - use
`async.await(task)` to read their result and `async.done(task)` to
poll. The benefit of running them under a group is the
scope-bounded lifetime: nothing leaks past `async.scope` returning.

Use `async.scope` when fan-out work must complete together: parallel
fetches in a request handler, concurrent file reads, building a batch
of results where any single failure should cancel the rest. For
fire-and-forget background tasks, stick to `async.run`.

## Async I/O submodules

The `async.io`, `async.http`, `async.net`, and `async.stream` source modules
wrap the corresponding native modules so every call returns a task. This
allows them to be started concurrently and awaited later.

Import them with an alias:

```gb
import async.io     as aio;
import async.http   as ahttp;
import async.net    as anet;
import async.stream as astream;
import async.rate   as rate;
```

### `async.io`

Task-returning wrappers for file and directory operations:

```gb
let t1 = aio.readText("data/users.json");
let t2 = aio.readText("data/config.json");
let users  = await t1;
let config = await t2;
```

Functions: `readText`, `writeText`, `appendText`, `readBytes`, `writeBytes`,
`appendBytes`, `read`, `readAll`, `write`, `writeln`, `flush`, `close`,
`stat`, `listDir`.

### `async.http`

Task-returning HTTP client calls:

```gb
let t = ahttp.get("https://api.example.com/users");
let response = await t;
let users = ahttp.parseJson(response);
```

Functions: `get`, `post`, `postJson`, `request`, `requestWithOptions`,
`parseJson`.

### `async.net`

Task-returning TCP/UDP socket operations. See `14-http-net.md` for the
synchronous `net` equivalents.

```gb
let listener = await anet.listenTcp("127.0.0.1:9000");
let conn     = await anet.accept(listener);
let data     = await anet.read(conn, 1024);
await anet.write(conn, data);
await anet.close(conn);
```

### `async.stream`

Task-returning wrappers for streaming parsers:

```gb
let stream = await astream.jsonStream(source, func(any value): void {
    io.println(json.stringify(value));
});
```

Functions: `jsonStream`, `jsonReader`, `yamlStream`, `yamlReader`,
`xmlStream`, `xmlReader`, `csvStream`, `csvReader`.

### `async.rate`

Rate-limit and debounce wrappers for callable values:

```gb
let log = rate.throttle(func(string m): void { io.println(m); }, 200);
log("a"); log("b"); log("c");                # only one io.println in 200ms

let save = rate.debounce(func(string text): void { persist(text); }, 300);
save("hello"); save("hello!"); save("hello world");
# persist("hello world") runs 300ms after the last call
```

| Function | Returns | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `rate.throttle(fn, ms)` | `func` | Calls `fn` at most once per `ms` ms; returns the cached last result for calls inside the window. |
| `rate.debounce(fn, ms)` | `func` | Returns a wrapper that, on each call, schedules `fn` to run after `ms` ms of quiet. Returns a `Task<any>` per call - the superseded ones resolve to `null`. |

## High-level task combinators: `async.tasks`

The `async.tasks` source module bundles common fan-out patterns so you
don't have to wire up the task plumbing by hand. Pair it with the
language-level `async` chapter (chapter 09), which covers `async func`,
`await`, and `Task<T>` in depth.

```gb
import async;
import async.tasks as tasks;
```

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `tasks.map(items, fn, opts?)` | Run `fn` over each item concurrently; results in input order. `opts.concurrency` caps parallelism (0 = unbounded). Fail-fast: the first error cancels the rest. |
| `tasks.forEach(items, fn, opts?)` | Like `map` but for side effects; returns `null`. |
| `tasks.retry(fn, opts?)` | Call `fn` with exponential-backoff retry. `opts`: `attempts` (3), `delayMs` (0), `factor` (2.0), `maxDelayMs` (0 = uncapped), `jitter` (false), `retryIf` (callable). |
| `tasks.settle(tasks)` | Await every task without fail-fast; per task `{"ok": true, "value": ...}` or `{"ok": false, "error": ...}`. |
| `tasks.any(tasks)` | Return the first task, in list order, that succeeds; throws if every task fails. |
| `tasks.parallel(fns)` | Run a list or dict of zero-arg callables concurrently. A list yields ordered results; a dict yields a same-keyed result dict. |

```gb
# Concurrent map with a parallelism cap of 4.
let bodies = tasks.map(urls, func(any u): any {
    return aio.readText(u as string);   # await happens inside the wrapped task
}, {"concurrency": 4});

# Retry a flaky call with backoff.
let result = tasks.retry(func(): any {
    return fetch();
}, {"attempts": 5, "delayMs": 100, "jitter": true});
```

## Concurrency primitives

For coordinating goroutine-backed tasks, three source modules provide
the low-level building blocks. Reach for these only when a `Store`
(below) or a channel doesn't fit; most code is better served by sharing
state through a `store.Store`.

### `async.sync` - locks and wait groups

```gb
import async.sync as sync;
```

| Class | Surface |
|-------|---------|
| `Mutex()` | `lock()`, `unlock()`, `tryLock()`. Mutual exclusion; not re-entrant. |
| `RWMutex()` | `lock()` / `unlock()` (writer, exclusive), `rLock()` / `rUnlock()` (reader, shared), plus `tryLock()` / `tryRLock()`. |
| `Semaphore(permits)` | `acquire()`, `release()`, `tryAcquire()`. Up to `permits` holders at once. |
| `WaitGroup()` | `add(delta)`, `done()`, `wait()`. Block until the counter reaches zero. |

```gb
let wg = sync.WaitGroup();
for (let int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    wg.add(1);
    async.run(func(): void {
        try { /* work */ } finally { wg.done(); }
    });
}
wg.wait();   # blocks until all ten finish
```

### `async.atomic` - lock-free cells

```gb
import async.atomic as atomic;
```

`AtomicInt(initial = 0)` is a sequentially-consistent int64 cell with
`load()`, `store(value)`, `add(delta)` (returns the new value), and
`compareAndSwap(old, next)`. `AtomicBool(initial = false)` is the same
shape for a flag (`load`, `store`, `compareAndSwap`), handy for
one-shot signals like closed / cancelled.

```gb
let counter = atomic.AtomicInt(0);
counter.add(1);
io.println(counter.load());   # 1
```

### `async.channel` - typed message passing

```gb
import async.channel as ch;
```

`Channel<T>(buffer = 0)` is a typed channel. `send(value)` and
`recv()` block; with a positive buffer, sends are non-blocking until
the buffer fills. `close()` halts further sends, after which recvs
drain the buffer then return `null`. Also: `trySend(value)` /
`tryRecv()` (non-blocking), and `isClosed()`. A channel iterates with
`for-in`, ending when it is closed and drained.

```gb
let c = ch.Channel<int>(8);
async.run(func(): void {
    for (let int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { c.send(i); }
    c.close();
});
for (v in c) {
    io.println(v);
}
```

### `async.token`

`async.token()` is a builtin that returns a fresh, uncompleted `Task`
used purely as a cancellation signal (it never resolves on its own).
The `time.scheduler` Timer / Ticker classes use it internally; reach
for it directly when you need a shared stop signal that several tasks
can poll with `async.done(token)`.

## Task values and properties

A task value exposes two read-only properties:

```gb
let t = compute();
if (t.done) {
    io.println("already finished");
}
if (t.cancelled) {
    io.println("was cancelled");
}
```

These are equivalent to `async.done(t)` and inspecting the cancellation state
set by `async.cancel(t)` / `t.cancel()`.

## Sharing state safely: `store.Store`

Tasks (and server request handlers) run concurrently on separate goroutines.
A plain `dict`, `list`, or object captured and mutated from more than one of
them at once is NOT safe: concurrent access to a shared container can crash the
process. The fix is not to lock every access (that would slow down all
single-threaded code); it is to put shared mutable state behind a primitive
built for concurrency.

`store.Store` is that primitive: a thread-safe key-value store. Every operation
is serialised internally, and values are deep-copied in and out, so a stored
value is an isolated snapshot that a caller cannot mutate behind the store's
back.

```gb
import store;

let s = store.Store();

s.set("config", {"theme": "dark"});   # deep-copied in
let cfg = s.get("config");            # deep-copied out (null if absent)

s.incr("requests");                   # atomic counter; missing key starts at 0
s.incr("bytes", 1024);                # add an explicit amount

# Atomic get-or-set: stores the default only if the key is absent.
let conn = s.getOrSet("pool", makePool());

# Atomic read-modify-write. `fn` receives the current value (null if absent)
# and its result is stored, retrying if another task changed the key first.
# Do NOT touch this same key non-atomically inside `fn`.
s.update("tally", func(any old): any {
    return (old == null ? 0 : old as int) + 1;
});
```

Full surface: `get`, `set`, `has`, `delete`, `clear`, `len`, `keys`, `values`,
`incr(key, delta = 1)`, `getOrSet(key, value)`,
`compareAndSet(key, expected, next)` (null matches an absent key), and
`update(key, fn)`. `keys()` / `values()` return snapshots in a deterministic
order.

Rule of thumb: each task / request runs with its own local variables; share
infrastructure (database pools, caches) through their own handles, and reach
for a `Store` whenever you need a shared mutable map. Do not share a plain
container across concurrent tasks.

There is also a lower-level functional API (`store.new()`, `store.get(h, key)`,
...) that the `Store` class wraps; prefer the class.
