# VS Code Extension

Geblang ships a VS Code extension in the `vscode-geblang/` directory of the
repository. It provides:

- **Syntax highlighting** for `.gb` files.
- **Live diagnostics** - parse and semantic errors appear as you type, via the
  built-in language server (`geblang lsp`).
- **Completion and signature help** for standard-library modules, functions,
  classes, and common language keywords.
- **Step debugging** - breakpoints, step over/into/out, call stack, and
  variable inspection, via the built-in debug adapter (`geblang dap`).

## Building The Extension

You need the `geblang` binary on your `PATH` before installing the extension.
See [Getting Started](01-getting-started.md) for build instructions.

### Option A - Docker (no Node.js required)

```sh
make vscode-build
```

This builds the extension inside a Docker container and writes the compiled
output to:

```
build/vscode/out/extension.js   compiled extension entry point
build/vscode/vsix/geblang.vsix  installable package (if vsce succeeded)
```

Install the VSIX from the terminal:

```sh
make vscode-install
# equivalent to:
code --install-extension build/vscode/vsix/geblang.vsix
```

> **WSL users:** do not use the VS Code GUI's *Install from VSIX…* dialog to
> install from a WSL path. VS Code on Windows cannot open VSIX files via
> `\\wsl.localhost\` UNC paths and will error with *"UNC host 'wsl.localhost'
> access is not allowed"*. Always install via `make vscode-install`, which
> copies the VSIX to the Windows temp directory before invoking `code`, so the
> path translation is handled automatically.

### Option B - Local Node.js

```sh
cd vscode-geblang
npm install
npm run compile
```

To also produce a VSIX package:

```sh
npx @vscode/vsce package --no-dependencies --out geblang.vsix
code --install-extension geblang.vsix
```

### Option C - Extension Development Host (no install needed)

Open the `vscode-geblang/` folder in VS Code, then press **F5**. VS Code
launches a second window with the extension already loaded. This is the fastest
path for iterating on the extension itself.

Prerequisite: run `npm install && npm run compile` first (or `make vscode-build`
to ensure `out/extension.js` exists).

## Requirements

| Requirement | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `geblang` on `PATH` | Language server and debug adapter |
| VS Code 1.80 or later | Extension host API |

If `geblang` is installed to a non-standard location, set the path in VS Code
settings (see [Settings](#settings) below).

## Features

### Syntax Highlighting

`.gb` files are highlighted automatically once the extension is active.
Keywords, types, string interpolation, operators, and comments are all
distinguished.

### Diagnostics

Open any `.gb` file and errors appear as red underlines immediately. Hover
over an underline to read the message. The Problems panel
(Ctrl+Shift+M / Cmd+Shift+M) lists all diagnostics across open files.

The language server runs `geblang lsp` as a subprocess. It re-analyses the
file on every change and sends results back to VS Code without touching the
file on disk.

### Completion And Signature Help

The language server exposes the bundled standard library to VS Code:

- Type `import ` to complete module names such as `io`, `http`, `db`, `web`,
  `collections`, `reflect`, and `websocket`.
- Type a module member access such as `io.` or `db.` to complete exported
  functions and classes.
- Type a function call such as `http.listen(` or `db.query(` to see the
  expected parameters and return shape.

Completion metadata is provided by the `geblang lsp` process, so it works with
the same executable configured for diagnostics and debugging.

### Step Debugging

#### Quick start

1. Open a `.gb` file.
2. Click in the gutter to set a breakpoint (red dot).
3. Press **F5** - VS Code picks up the default launch configuration and starts
   the debug adapter.
4. Execution pauses at the breakpoint. Use the debug toolbar or keyboard
   shortcuts to step:

| Action | Shortcut |
|---|---|
| Continue | F5 |
| Step Over | F10 |
| Step Into | F11 |
| Step Out | Shift+F11 |
| Stop | Shift+F5 |

The **Variables** panel shows all local variables at the current scope. The
**Call Stack** panel shows the active call frames.

#### launch.json

For more control, add a `.vscode/launch.json` to your workspace:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "geblang",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Run current file",
      "program": "${file}",
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "stopOnEntry": false
    },
    {
      "type": "geblang",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Run with args",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/main.gb",
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "args": ["--verbose"],
      "stopOnEntry": true
    }
  ]
}
```

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `program` | string | (required) | Path to the `.gb` script to run |
| `cwd` | string | `${workspaceFolder}` | Working directory used when running and resolving local modules |
| `args` | string[] | `[]` | Arguments passed to the script |
| `stopOnEntry` | boolean | `false` | Pause at the first statement |
| `geblangPath` | string | `"geblang"` | Override the `geblang` binary path |

#### Known limitations

- The debug adapter runs scripts on the evaluator path. Scripts that require
  `--vm-strict` mode may behave differently under the debugger.
- Only the main script file has source-mapped breakpoints. Breakpoints set in
  imported modules are not yet supported.
- Variable inspection shows the local scope only. Module-level and outer-scope
  variables are not currently exposed.

These limitations are expected to be lifted in a post-1.0.0 release.

## Settings

Open **File → Preferences → Settings** (or Cmd+, on macOS) and search for
`geblang`.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `geblang.executablePath` | `"geblang"` | Absolute path to the `geblang` binary. Useful when `geblang` is not on the system `PATH`. |
| `geblang.executionMode` | `"auto"` | Launch mode: `auto`, `native`, or `wsl`. `auto` runs native executables directly and uses `wsl.exe` only for Linux/WSL paths on Windows. |

Example `settings.json` entry:

```json
{
  "geblang.executablePath": "/usr/local/bin/geblang",
  "geblang.executionMode": "auto"
}
```

On native Windows, point `geblang.executablePath` at `geblang.exe` or leave it
as `geblang` if the executable is on `PATH`. On Windows with WSL, set the path
to a Linux path such as `/home/me/bin/geblang` and leave
`geblang.executionMode` as `auto`, or set it explicitly to `wsl`.

## Troubleshooting

**"UNC host 'wsl.localhost' access is not allowed" when installing VSIX**
You are on Windows with WSL and used the GUI's *Install from VSIX…* dialog to
navigate to a file under `\\wsl.localhost\`. VS Code cannot install VSIXs via
UNC paths. Run `make vscode-install` from your WSL terminal instead - it copies
the VSIX to `C:\Windows\Temp\` before calling `code`, so the Windows process
gets a native path it can read.

**Syntax highlighting not working**
Confirm the extension is active: open the Extensions panel and check that
*Geblang* is listed and enabled.

**No diagnostics appearing**
Check the Output panel (Ctrl+Shift+U / Cmd+Shift+U), select **Geblang
Language Server** from the dropdown, and look for startup errors. The most
common cause is `geblang` not being found on `PATH`. Set
`geblang.executablePath` to the full binary path.

**Breakpoints not binding**
Ensure the file is saved before starting a debug session. Breakpoints in
unsaved buffers are shown as grey (unverified) and will not pause execution.

**Debug session exits immediately**
The script may have a parse error. Check the Debug Console for the error
message, fix it, and re-launch.
