# Async And Generators

## Async Functions

Async functions use `async func`. Calling one starts it and returns a `Task`.
The call itself does not block; the program only waits when it reaches `await`
or `task.await()`.

```gb
async func double(int x): int {
    return x * 2;
}

let task = double(21);
io.println("calculation has started");
io.println(await task);
```

Tasks can also be inspected:

```gb
io.println(task.done());
io.println(task.await());
```

## Async Module

```gb
import async;

let worker = async.run(func(): int {
    return 42;
});

io.println(async.await(worker));
await async.sleep(100);
```

`async.done(task)` reports completion.

### Combining tasks

`async.all([tasks])` returns a new task that completes when every input task
has completed. The result is a list of values in the original order. If any
input fails, the returned task fails immediately with the first error and the
remaining tasks are cancelled.

```gb
import async;
import io;

let pageA = async.run(func(): string {
    await async.sleep(40);
    return "A";
});
let pageB = async.run(func(): string {
    await async.sleep(60);
    return "B";
});

let pages = await async.all([pageA, pageB]);
io.println(pages[0]);  # "A"
io.println(pages[1]);  # "B"
```

`async.race([tasks])` returns a task that completes with the first finisher's
value. The rest are cancelled.

```gb
let fast = async.run(func(): string {
    await async.sleep(20);
    return "fast";
});
let slow = async.run(func(): string {
    await async.sleep(200);
    return "slow";
});

io.println(await async.race([fast, slow]));  # "fast"
```

### Timeouts

`async.timeout(task, ms)` wraps a task with a deadline. If the task does not
complete within the given milliseconds, the wrapping task fails with a
`RuntimeError` and the inner task is cancelled.

```gb
let slow = async.run(func(): string {
    await async.sleep(500);
    return "never";
});

# Awaiting the timeout wrapper raises a runtime error when the deadline expires:
let result = await async.timeout(slow, 50);   # runtime error after 50ms
```

### Cancellation

A task can be cancelled explicitly with `async.cancel(task)` or `task.cancel()`.
Cancelling marks the task complete with a sentinel error, so any pending or
later `await` returns with that error. Use `task.cancelled` to check the state
non-destructively.

```gb
let job = async.run(func(): int {
    await async.sleep(1000);
    return 1;
});

job.cancel();
io.println(job.cancelled);   # true
```

## Doing Work While A Task Runs

A common mistake is to start a task and immediately await it. That is valid, but
it gives the program no opportunity to do useful work concurrently.

This version blocks straight away:

```gb
let result = await fetchReport();
io.println(result);
```

This version starts the work, continues with local work, then waits only when
the result is actually needed:

```gb
async func fetchReport(): string {
    await async.sleep(100);
    return "report ready";
}

let reportTask = fetchReport();

io.println("started report");
io.println("loading local config");
io.println("rendering progress indicator");

let report = await reportTask;
io.println(report);
```

For polling-style workflows, use `async.done`:

```gb
import async;
import io;

async func background(): string {
    await async.sleep(150);
    return "background result";
}

let task = background();

while (!async.done(task)) {
    io.println("tick");
    await async.sleep(25);
}

io.println(async.await(task));
```

The important rule is that a task value is just a value. Store it in a variable,
put it in a list, pass it to another function, or await it later.

```gb
func awaitAll(list<Task<string>> tasks): list<string> {
    list<string> results = [];
    for (task in tasks) {
        results = results.push(await task);
    }
    return results;
}
```

## Concurrent I/O Shape

Async is most useful around I/O, timers, HTTP calls, sockets, and work that can
run independently. Prefer the async stdlib wrappers for I/O instead of writing
your own `async func` around synchronous calls:

```gb
import async.io as aio;

let configTask = aio.readText("config/app.json");
let templateTask = aio.readText("templates/page.html");

io.println("both reads have started");

let config = await configTask;
let template = await templateTask;
```

If the second operation depends on the first result, await between them:

```gb
let config = await readConfig();
let template = await readTemplateFor(config);
```

That sequential form is clearer and avoids pretending dependent work is
parallel.

Async modules currently include:

- `async.io`: file and handle reads/writes.
- `async.http`: HTTP client calls.
- `async.net`: TCP/UDP socket operations.
- `async.stream`: JSON, YAML, XML, and CSV streaming parser work.

These APIs return `Task` values. Their current implementation runs host I/O work
outside the caller's flow; the roadmap target is a shared event-loop scheduler
that can power higher-throughput networking engines without changing these
public module APIs.

Example socket workflow:

```gb
import async;
import async.net as anet;
import bytes;
import net;

let listener = await anet.listenTcp("127.0.0.1:0");
let address = net.localAddr(listener);

let server = async.run(func(): string {
    let conn = await anet.accept(listener);
    let message = await anet.read(conn, 4);
    await anet.write(conn, "pong");
    await anet.close(conn);
    return bytes.toString(message);
});

let client = await anet.connectTcp(address);
await anet.write(client, "ping");
io.println(bytes.toString(await anet.read(client, 4)));
io.println(await server);
```

## Error Handling In Tasks

Errors thrown inside an async task are re-raised when the task is awaited:

```gb
async func loadRequired(string path): string {
    if (!io.exists(path)) {
        throw IOError("missing file: " + path);
    }
    return io.readText(path);
}

let task = loadRequired("settings.json");

try {
    io.println(await task);
} catch (IOError e) {
    io.println("could not load settings: " + e.message);
}
```

Use this pattern to start work early, then handle the failure at the point where
the result becomes necessary.

## Generators

Generator functions use `yield` and return lazy `generator` values:

```gb
func numbers(): generator<int> {
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
    yield 3;
}

for (n in numbers()) {
    io.println(n);
}
```

Function literals can be generators:

```gb
let upTo = func(int max): generator<int> {
    for (let int i = 1; i <= max; i++) {
        yield i;
    }
};
```

## Iterable Parameters

Use `iterable<T>` when an API accepts generator-like inputs:

```gb
func sum(iterable<int> values): int {
    int total = 0;
    for (n in values) {
        total += n;
    }
    return total;
}
```

Generators are lazy. Breaking out of a `for-in` loop closes the producer so
unbounded streams do not continue running.

```gb
func lines(list<string> paths): generator<string> {
    for (path in paths) {
        for (line in io.readText(path).split("\n")) {
            yield line;
        }
    }
}

for (line in lines(["a.log", "b.log"])) {
    if (line.contains("ERROR")) {
        io.println(line);
        break;
    }
}
```

Generators and async solve different problems. Generators avoid building a full
collection before iteration. Async tasks allow other work to continue while a
result is pending. For a large remote dataset, an API should usually combine
both ideas: fetch or read chunks asynchronously, then yield records lazily.

## Channels (1.7.0)

Typed message-passing between tasks. `import async.channel`
exposes the `Channel<T>` class.

```gb
import async;
import async.channel as ch;

let c = ch.Channel<int>(0);   # 0 = unbuffered handoff
async.run(func(): void {
    for (let int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { c.send(i); }
    c.close();
});
for (var v in c) {
    io.println(v);
}
```

Constructor: `Channel<T>(buffer = 0)`. With `buffer = 0` send blocks
until a receiver is ready (synchronous handoff); a positive buffer
lets up to that many values sit pending before sends block.

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `send(value)` | `void` | Sends value; blocks if the buffer is full. Throws on send-after-close. |
| `recv()` | `T?` | Receives the next value; blocks until one is available. Returns `null` once the channel is closed and drained. |
| `trySend(value)` | `bool` | Non-blocking send. Returns `true` if completed, `false` if it would have blocked. Throws on send-after-close. |
| `tryRecv()` | `T?` | Non-blocking receive. Returns the next value or `null` if none is immediately available. Pair with `isClosed()` to distinguish "no value pending" from "closed and drained". |
| `close()` | `void` | Halts further sends and lets recvs drain to the end. Double-close throws. |
| `isClosed()` | `bool` | Reports closed state. Cheap atomic load. |

Channels implement the iterator protocol, so `for (x in channel)`
blocks on each recv and exits when the channel is closed and
drained. This is the idiomatic consumer pattern:

```gb
for (var msg in incoming) {
    handle(msg);
}
```

### Typical patterns

**Producer / consumer**: producer task closes the channel when
done; consumer's `for-in` exits naturally.

**Fan-in to one consumer**: many producers share one channel;
close it from a coordinator once a WaitGroup observes the
producers are done.

```gb
import async;
import async.channel as ch;
import async.sync as sync;

let c = ch.Channel<int>(16);
let wg = sync.WaitGroup();
for (let int p = 0; p < 5; p++) {
    wg.add(1);
    async.run(func(): void {
        produceInto(c);
        wg.done();
    });
}
async.run(func(): void { wg.wait(); c.close(); });

for (var v in c) { consume(v); }
```

**Non-blocking poll**: use `tryRecv()` when you want to check for
work without blocking. Pair with `isClosed()` to decide whether to
keep polling.

### Sentinel caveat

`recv()` returns `null` on a closed-drained channel. If you send
real `null` values, consumers cannot distinguish them from the
end-of-channel signal. Either avoid sending null or wrap your
values in a small dict / class.

### `select` statement (1.7.0)

`select` waits on multiple channel operations at once and runs
the case whose op becomes ready first. Cases are recv-with-
binding, recv-discard, send, plus an optional `default`.

```gb
select {
    case let v = c1.recv(): {
        handleC1(v);
    }
    case let s = c2.recv(): {
        handleC2(s);
    }
    case c3.send(payload): {
        sentToC3();
    }
    default: {
        nothingReady();
    }
}
```

The case head must be `c.recv()` (with or without a `let` binding)
or `c.send(value)`. The binding is scoped to the case body and
holds the received value (or `null` if the channel was
closed-drained at the moment of dispatch).

`default` makes the select opportunistic: if no other case can
fire immediately, the default body runs. Without `default`,
select blocks until at least one case is ready.

When several cases are simultaneously ready, the chosen one is
pseudo-random (Go's `reflect.Select` semantics) so producers and
consumers cannot starve each other through ordering.

## Synchronisation Primitives (1.6.0)

Tasks spawned via `async.run` execute as real goroutines, so when
multiple tasks coordinate over shared state the standard
synchronisation primitives apply. They live in two sub-modules
that wrap Go's `sync` and `sync/atomic` packages.

### `async.sync`: locks, semaphores, wait groups

```gb
import async.sync as sync;

let m = sync.Mutex();
m.lock();
try {
    # protected section
} finally {
    m.unlock();
}
```

| Class | Methods | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `Mutex` | `lock`, `unlock`, `tryLock` | Mutual-exclusion lock. `tryLock()` returns `false` instead of blocking when the lock is held. |
| `RWMutex` | `lock`, `unlock`, `tryLock`, `rLock`, `rUnlock`, `tryRLock` | Reader-writer lock. Many readers may coexist; writers are exclusive. |
| `Semaphore` | `acquire`, `release`, `tryAcquire` | Counted concurrency guard. Constructor: `Semaphore(permits)`; permits must be at least 1. |
| `WaitGroup` | `add(delta)`, `done`, `wait` | Counter for "this many tasks are running"; `wait()` blocks until the counter hits zero. |

### `async.atomic`: lock-free cells

```gb
import async.atomic as atomic;

let counter = atomic.AtomicInt(0);
counter.add(1);
if (counter.compareAndSwap(1, 42)) {
    /* succeeded */
}
```

| Class | Methods | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `AtomicInt` | `load`, `store(v)`, `add(delta)`, `compareAndSwap(old, new)` | Sequentially consistent int64. `add` returns the new value; `delta` may be negative. |
| `AtomicBool` | `load`, `store(v)`, `compareAndSwap(old, new)` | Sequentially consistent bool. Common for one-shot flags. |

### Typical patterns

**Counting completed tasks**:

```gb
import async;
import async.sync as sync;

let wg = sync.WaitGroup();
for (let int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    wg.add(1);
    async.run(func(): void {
        try { doWork(i); } finally { wg.done(); }
    });
}
wg.wait();
```

**Bounded concurrency**:

```gb
import async;
import async.sync as sync;

let throttle = sync.Semaphore(10);   # at most 10 in flight
for (var url in urls) {
    async.run(func(): void {
        throttle.acquire();
        try { fetch(url); } finally { throttle.release(); }
    });
}
```

**Lock-free counter**:

```gb
import async.atomic as atomic;
let hits = atomic.AtomicInt(0);
# in many tasks:
hits.add(1);
# later:
io.println(hits.load());
```

### Sharing mutable state safely

Because tasks run as real goroutines, two tasks (or a task and the main
flow) that touch the **same mutable value** at the same time are a data
race - exactly as in any threaded language. A class instance, list, dict,
or set has no built-in locking, so concurrent writes (or a write racing a
read) have undefined behaviour and can abort the program.

```gb
# WRONG: many tasks mutating one shared object with no synchronisation.
class Counter { int n; func bump(): void { this.n = this.n + 1; } }
let c = Counter();
for (let int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    async.run(func(): void { c.bump(); });   # data race on c.n
}
```

Make shared access explicit with the tools above:

- **A lock** around the critical section:

  ```gb
  import async.sync as sync;
  let m = sync.Mutex();
  async.run(func(): void {
      m.lock();
      try { c.bump(); } finally { m.unlock(); }
  });
  ```

- **An atomic** cell for a single counter or flag (`atomic.AtomicInt`).
- **A channel** to hand values to one owning task instead of sharing the
  object (`async.channel`).
- **A `store.Store`** for shared mutable key-value state. It is a thread-safe
  map that serialises every access and deep-copies values in and out, with
  atomic `incr`, `getOrSet`, `compareAndSet`, and `update(key, fn)`. Reach for
  it instead of guarding a plain dict by hand:

  ```gb
  import store;
  let s = store.Store();
  async.run(func(): void { s.incr("done"); });   # atomic, no lost updates
  ```

The concurrency primitives themselves - `async.channel`, `async.sync`,
and `async.atomic` - are safe to share across tasks; that is their
purpose. The rule applies to ordinary objects you create.

If a task only needs its own copy, pass the data in as an argument rather
than closing over a shared variable, so each task works on independent
state.

The same rule covers whole-object operations: serialising
(`json.stringify(obj)`), reflecting over, or otherwise reading all of an
object's fields while another task mutates it is a read-while-write race.
Take the lock (or hand the object to a single owning task) around those
reads too, not just around individual field writes.
